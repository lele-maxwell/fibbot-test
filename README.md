# Hello world test 

##### This is a simple test repos to verify or confirm a particaular  match in a file 

A workflow was implemented that will run successfully if the match contents was found i.e the code is executed and the output state 
determine if the workflow should  proceed 

If the match is not found, the execution will exit with a 1 state and the workflow will fail 

If the the match is found, the execution will exit with a 0 state and the workflow will be a success

##### This implies that if the workflow run's successfully, it implies the match content was found " Hello world! "
